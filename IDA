?????????       Finction Flags        ????????????????????????????????????????????
FUNC_NORET: This flag is used to identify a function that does not execute a return instruction. It’s
            internally represented as equal to 1.
FUNC_FAR: This flag is rarely seen unless reversing software that uses segmented memory. It is internally 
          represented as an integer of 2.
FUNC_USERFAR: This f lag is rarely seen and has very little documentation. HexRays describes the flag as
            "user has specified far-ness of the function”. It has an internal value of 32.
FUNC_LIB: This flag is used to find library code. It’ internally represented as an integer value of 4.
FUNC_STATIC: This flag is used to identify functions that were compiled as a static function.
FUNC_FRAME: This flag indicates the function uses a frame pointer ebp .
FUNC_BOTTOMBP: Similar to FUNC_FRAME this flag is used to track the frame pointer. It will identify functions
            that frame pointers is equal to the stack pointer.
FUNC_HIDDEN: Functions with the FUNC_HIDDEN flag means they are hidden and will need to be expanded
             to view.
FUNC_THUNK: This flag identifies functions that are thunk functions. They are simple functions that jump
            to another function.

?????????       Operands       ????????????????????????????????????????????
o_void:  an instruction does not have any operands it will return 0.
o_reg:   If an operand is a general register it will return this type. This value is internally represented
         as 1.
o_mem:   If an operand is direct memory ref erence it will return this type. This value is internally
         represented as 2. e.g., ds:dword_A152B8
o_phrase: operand is returned if the operand consists of a base register and/or a index register.
          This value is internally represented as 3. eg, [edi+ecx]
o_displ:  This operand is returned if the operand consists of registers and a displacement value.  
          Internally it is represented as a value of 4. e.g., [edi+18h]
 o_imm:   Operands that are a value such as an integer of 0xC are of this type. Internally it is
          represented as 5.        
 o_far:   This operand is not very common when reversing x86 or x86_64 . It is used to f ind operands
          that are accessing immediate f ar addresses. It is represented internally as 6.
 o_near:  This operand is not very common when reversing x86 or x86_64 . It is used to f ind operands
          that are accessing immediate near addresses. It is represented internally as 7.
